Deep Learning Cheatsheet (Not like others)

In this repository I try to implement three different architectures in different frameworks (and versions). For now, I have decided to implement a basic architecture (like Vgg), and two more advanced architectures in PyTorch, Tensorflow 1 (keras), and Tensorflow 2. 

Right now I haven't decided the advanced architectures yet. But I guess architectures that have custom layers would be the best. Maybe something like Mobilenet or Deformable Convolution. Let me know if you like to participate!

The goal is to be able to refer to this notebook to quickly recall the syntax and names, when I haven't used the particular framework for a while.
